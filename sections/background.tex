To produce a PDF file, pdf\LaTeX{} is strongly recommended (over original \LaTeX{} plus dvips+ps2pdf or dvipdf).
The style file \texttt{acl.sty} can also be used with
lua\LaTeX{} and
Xe\LaTeX{}, which are especially suitable for text in non-Latin scripts.
The file \texttt{acl\_lualatex.tex} in this repository provides
an example of how to use \texttt{acl.sty} with either
lua\LaTeX{} or
Xe\LaTeX{}.
